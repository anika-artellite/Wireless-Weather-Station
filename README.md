# Weather-Station
This project uses two ESP-32 boards to create a simple wireless weather station that measures temperature and humidity using the AHT20T sensor. One ESP32 collects sensor data, and the other ESP32 receives it and displays the values on an LCD screen. 

Features:
- Wireless communication between two ESP32 boards
- Temperature + humidity readings via AHT20T sensor
- Live display on LCD

Materials:
- 2 ESP-32 Microcontrollers
- 1 AHT20 Sensor
- LCD that uses I2C
- 1 Photoresistor
- 2 Breadboards
- Jumper Wires
- 1 9V Battery
- Micro USB Cable
